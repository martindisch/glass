The glass system from the [M.E.R.C.S. campaign](http://forums.bistudio.com/showthread.php?177261-SP-Campaign-M-E-R-C-S-mercenary-expendable-ruthless-covert-selfish) by IndeedPete as a standalone mod.

**Features:**
* 3D markers for known units
* View information about other units
* Shows user status such as current health, position and heading
* Improves visibility in dark environments without NVG
* NEW: Distance to target information

Dependencies
============

This mod requires [CBA_A3](http://forums.bistudio.com/showthread.php?178224-CBA-Community-Base-Addons-ARMA-3) to run.

Build
=====

The `Addons` folder in the root of this repository needs to be in a mod folder, so it looks like `@glass\Addons`. `@glass\Addons\glass` then needs to be turned into a PBO, resulting in the already existing `@glass\Addons\glass.pbo`. The original `@glass\Addons\glass` folder can then be deleted and the complete package is ready.
